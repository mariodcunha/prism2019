         "abstract":"This Symposium talk will delve into the process and methodology behind computationally sorting and analyzing image archives as a way to shed light on the complexity, multiplicity, and potential fallacy of the image as a data point. Reflections on this process will cover the technical implications of employing machine learning techniques within the archive. For instance, what does it mean to computationally sort analog (and also non-western) images with pre-trained machine learning algorithms that have largely been trained on born-digital, western-centric images? What exactly are the advantages and disadvantages of a computational or \"distant reading\" of an image archive? How might we build more robust and diverse corpii of training set images for algorithms in the archive?\r\n In addition to technical insights, this talk will also discuss insight gained from second-hand research and speaking with archivists, photographers, and librarians about imaging technologies, collective history, and formulations of identity. The photograph is a particularly salient data point in the archive. The archive of studio photography from the Tamil Studies in Studio Archives and Society (S.T.A.R.S) surfaces an interesting and important aesthetic history but also points to many strategies used in the photo studio such as backdrops, props, and overpainting to formulate identity in collaboration with the subject, further complicating these images as a source of data. These nuances propose interesting challenges for the application of machine learning in sorting these types of images but also raise an even broader question of how the images we produce, disseminate, and preserve through technology have a big impact on who gets to be seen and how they are seen. Here we can start to see a connection between the history of the camera as an emerging technology and contemporary computer vision technologies. Although it may seem obvious, it is always important to understand that the tools with which we look have an impact on what we see.",

Through the use of these techniques, the artist performatively questions the notion of collective and individual identity, and the complexity, multiplicity, and potential fallacy of the image as a data point.",

This project, in part, explores how all scientific laboratories practice recycling. It also investigates the best practices, areas for improvement, and the overall possibility for recycling to take place within biosafety level 1 (BLS 1) spaces since there are no associated biological risks. Furthermore, this project seeks to answer several questions in regards to biomaterials, biomaterials education, and best practices for building out lab spaces for students who are interested in learning the best methods for biomaterials. Finally, this project explores product design through the development of educational kits for students to practice simple, non-hazardous biological procedures at home or in design spaces. Because of the complexity of this project, this document will be broken into several related but stand-alone sections, the goal being twofold: to provide a comprehensive take on sustainability within BSL 1 labs and to provide insight into the development and implementation of biomaterial studies at the university level for interested design students.",

The film is continuously unraveling new perspectives of the garment from all angles. \r\n \r\n The audience may decide on what time a garment it is but as the film progresses over time their perspectives are changed with the constant unfolding of the garment. As I pursue this journey, the narrative of this project tells a story of empowerment and control. A new form of how a garment is being moved in space. This installation will look into how this new hybrid of a garment & body as one will create a hypnotizing illusion in the space with the inclusion translucent material on the garment as well the animations of projection mapping intertwining within the garment. As the audience walks into the space, they will feel a static response to what is happening to the garment.

These awkward furniture arrangement might seem absurd but it could happen every time we enter an unfamiliar space and try to compromise on it. When we were given a spacious and comfortable space, we have full control over the layout which allows us to keep our habits and routines. However, when living in a space full of fragmented rooms, crooked hallway, and tiled floor, we are forced to change our daily routine.

This project meant to embrace the notion of the weirdness and erase the essence and interaction between humans and machines. Dehuman was composed of several physical computing sculptures. Each of the sculpture represents a specific human body part, including eyes, nose, ear, and mouth also serves as a study of human beings‘ structures and mechanisms. They are functional machines without functionalities, they are not design-product that aims to solve a specific problem. Instead, those sculptures are living entities powering and operating automatically, with the input provided by the surroundings and human beings. The presence of these sculpture should bear the meaning of anthropomorphism and leave audiences uneasy questions about the relationship between man and machine. The installation’s juxtaposition takes place in the exposure of electronic parts but also the resemblance to human beings.",

My research also includes study of current user interaction and user interface design practices in handheld augmented reality applications. My goal is to create a design system for designers with little to no 3D experience, small development teams, creators who are new to augmented reality and enthusiasts. The language system will consist of an augmented reality application that explains the terminology in an interactive manner, along with a website with detailed documentations.",

Nevertheless, it remains one of the most poorly understood areas of science, creating misconceptions and faux knowledge. In part because its complexity is a formidable barrier between the scientific community and wider audiences. \r\n \r\n Many scientific topics that are incredibly interesting but have complicated language and a lack of good visuals unintentionally restrict access for a general audience. Some people are willing to learn, curiosity can be awoken in others who don't know what they like or just are skeptical, but curiosity can be awakened by evoking a visual experience. Because there are different kinds of learning, therefore understanding, a wide audience may require different types of stimuli.

There is so much hidden agenda behind this service that we don't know. This wheel of technology is taking us in an unanticipated negative direction, and it is urgent for us to draw a moral red line for technology in human society. But the first step is to make sure people understand this issue. As a designer, I would like to take this step to alert people about the unfair dynamics and the hidden agenda of personalized content recommendation services.\r\n \r\n For this wonderful vision, Preference Harvest is designed. It is a two-player game for generation Z (born from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s) which reveals the biased dynamics of online personalized content recommendation services and how they manipulate users for the attention economics. Two players, the user and the algorithm, battle with each other in the system that is biased toward the algorithm. By experiencing the unbalanced gameplay from different perspectives, players can feel the role of being manipulated and having restricted power in this dynamic. Once they take away the unfair dynamics of personalization services through the game, they will question the norms and guidelines of technology, and further, push the technology into a promising future.",

I set my own experience and my own story inside it for context; it told my story since I decided to change my previous major – law, to design. Because I am the person comparing with obeying the rules, I prefer to create the rules. Then, I left my country and came to New York City to learn design. But not everything went well at first since I encountered so many problems, such as racism and stalking. These things caused me problems for a while, but dance made me find the right way and provide me a comfortable zone in this big city. When I dance, my body movements express my feelings and release my pressures. \r\n As a designer I want to express my feelings via my design work and let the audience experience what I feel and what I think when they interact with my installation. I even hope this interactive installation can inspire people to dance spontaneously without any instructions.",
