## Feedback:
- Juan 3-20: Hey all! I've started using the ReadMe doc to keep track of all the work. This should minimize meetings and we can dedicate our time to working.
  - Edit/Modify this document as you think best, and make any updates you think are important.
  - The link below is documentation on how to use the syntax.
- Juan 3-20: Website looking great for initial launch. I really like the 3D cubes on homepage, I think we can iterate on it. Would like to add some more color, but we can discuss.
