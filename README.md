## Feedback:
- Juan 3-20: Hey all! I've started using the ReadMe doc to keep track of all the work. This should minimize meetings and we can dedicate our time to working.
  - Edit/Modify this document as you think best, and make any updates you think are important.
  - The link below is documentation on how to use the syntax.

- Juan 3-20: Website looking great for initial launch. I really like the 3D cubes on homepage, I think we can iterate on it. Would like to add some more color, but we can discuss.

- Mario 4-2: Yes. I'm open to any iterations to the cubes. Those are just something I threw in for starters. I'm working on making them triangular, and I did it! But, the problem is that when I rotate them, each face rotates, skewing the entire shape to be ugly. The whole shape must rotate from the center as one object, which isnt happening. But open to any other iteration. More color too!

- Iris 4-8: I've updated the mainLogo by adding two pngs to the assets folder. "mainLogo_new_B.png" and "mainLogo_new_W.png". I also adjusted the css for mainLogo for a little bit.

- Barsha 4-21 : I added individual page and for now put it under projects tab. I changed the css of nav bar for this page because it was conflicting with the divs below. So, the fonts of the menu here is not similar to the index and events page. Also, the margin is slightly different. I tried a lot but could not get it to match but I think we should lower the size of the navbar on all the other pages except index page. Let me know your thoughts.

Should we change the background of all the page to the color on the individual pages instead of black like the events page?

Yet to make it responsive.

I am not sure how to call the grid images in the projects and peoples page since I think in the previous code all the images are called by js.

- Juan 4-27: The script to build the JSON file has been created. Once we have the photos from the branding team, we should be able to populate the people and projects pages.
